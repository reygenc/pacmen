# PacMen

An interactive page that creates a PacMan with a click of a button.

[This link will open the page.](https://reygenc.github.io/pacmen/)

To use the PacMen page, click on the "Add PacMan" button. Everytime the button is clicked, it will add another PacMan at a random location. 
When ready, click on the "Start Game" button. This will make the PacMen move. Everytime the button is clicked, the Pacmen will move faster.

In the future, I would like to make this so that the PacMen open and close their mouths when moving. After that, I would like to have the PacMen reverse directions if they collide with another PacMan.
